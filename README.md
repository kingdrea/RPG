## Introduction

Reinforcement learning has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in complex environments. The Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) method introduces a novel approach to enhance the stability and performance of policy gradient methods. By applying regularization techniques, RPG improves learning efficiency and reduces variance, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Integration**: Leverage the power of deep learning frameworks for scalable training.
- **Foundation Models**: Utilize pre-trained models to enhance learning.
- **Post-Training Adaptation**: Adapt the model after initial training to improve performance.
- **Reinforcement Learning Techniques**: Implement state-of-the-art RL methods.
- **Large Language Models**: Incorporate LLMs for advanced decision-making.

## Installation

To get started with RPG, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingdrea/RPG.git
   cd RPG
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Releases section](https://github.com/kingdrea/RPG/releases). Download the latest release, and execute the provided scripts to set up your environment.

## Usage

To use RPG in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   from rpg import RPGAgent
   ```

2. Initialize the agent with your environment:

   ```python
   agent = RPGAgent(env)
   ```

3. Train the agent:

   ```python
   agent.train(episodes=1000)
   ```

4. Evaluate the agent's performance:

   ```python
   agent.evaluate()
   ```

For more detailed usage instructions, please check the documentation within the repository.

## Examples

We provide several examples to help you get started with RPG. You can find them in the `examples` directory. Here are a few key examples:

- **CartPole**: A classic reinforcement learning environment. This example demonstrates how to balance a pole on a moving cart using RPG.
- **Atari Games**: Use RPG to play Atari games like Breakout and Space Invaders. This showcases the capability of RPG in complex environments.
- **Custom Environments**: Learn how to implement RPG in your custom environments.

To run an example, use the following command:

```bash
python examples/cartpole.py
```
